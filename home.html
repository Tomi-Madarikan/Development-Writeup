    <h1>DEVELOPMENT WRITEUP:</h1>
   <h2>Application Goals and Value to A User:</h2>
<p>
This application is an online stationery shop. Users can choose from a range of twelve products including pencils, highlighters and pencil cases. The value to a user is that the app provides a one-stop shop for all of the stationery that you could fill your pencil case with. 
</p>
<h2>Usability Principles Considered:</h2>
<p>
The app is easy to navigate because the filters and sort functions are all clearly displayed near the top of the page. Each product is displayed in a card that also lists the corresponding price, size and colour of the product. These cards are grouped in columns of 4 with uniform size and dimensions. Additionally, each card contains an ‘Add to Cart’ button and a “remove from Cart” button that enables adding/removing to and from the aggregator (the Shopping Cart). </p> <p> The shopping cart is located at the bottom of the page and the total price of items in the cart clearly updates(aggregates) whenever a user adds/removes items to/from the aggregator. I believe that this layout fosters learnability and usability.
I kept the colours simple and kept the contrast between text, images and background colour sufficiently high to foster readability.</p>
